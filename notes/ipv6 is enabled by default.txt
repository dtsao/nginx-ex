After removing nginx.conf so pod uses the default nginx.conf from the s2i image, redeploy. Now pod is crashing with this error:


2019/07/24 21:49:15 [emerg] 1#0: socket() [::]:8080 failed (97: Address family not supported by protocol)
nginx: [emerg] socket() [::]:8080 failed (97: Address family not supported by protocol)

IPV6 is not enabled.

Adding nginx.conf back to disable IPV6.
